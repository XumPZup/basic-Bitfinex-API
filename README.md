# basic-Bitfinex-API
A basic bitfinex api that can be used for authentication and submit limit orders.
Sources I used:
https://github.com/bitfinexcom/bitfinex-api-py/blob/master/bfxapi/utils/auth.py (For the authentication)
https://github.com/akcarsten/bitfinex_api/blob/master/bitfinex/bitfinex_v2.py (To get wallets info and submit orders)
I did this because I found some errors in reguard of the authentication from the second repo and I didn't want to use the async methods from the first repo.
